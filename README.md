- 👋 Hi, I’m @JosephRivera-ngt aka Joey.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming new things, learning frameworks, hackathons. 
- 🌱 I’m still learning the source code for opportunity. Show me something I haven't seen yet!
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on the new react frontend for admin portal. Love how it's turning out.
- 📫 How to reach me you can get hold me at jriveracode@gmail.com or slack (I check my slack more than my email).
